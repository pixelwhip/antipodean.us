    <p class="post-intro">We spent a weekend chugging up and down the Murray River watching the scenery drift by.</p>
    <div id="map"><div class="map-vignette"></div></div>


<p>We left town after work on Friday.  Arrived in Manuhm (sic) a couple hours later. We took the ferry across the river. Got to the boat. Said hello. Picked a room and unpacked.</p>
<p>Got into dinner and beers while the rest of the travellers arrived.</p>
<p>We spent the night moored at the ferry dock.</p>
<p>The next morning, we were breifed on piloting the house boat and let loose upon  the river.  We spent most the day pushing upstream at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>We had one midday stop for a walk.  We moored among thick grasses and shrubs with the hopes of finding a trail along the seemingly wild rocky slopes beyond.  The Canadians bush wacked their way through a few meters of branchy bush to find that what lied beyond was not a hiking path, but a highway.</p>
<p>Not to be detered.   A few members of the party set off to stretch there legs along the rural properties of the populated road.</p>
<p>That night we setup camp on a stretch of land between the River and a lake.  We made a campfire, drank some wine and had a good ole aussie bbq.</p>
<p>The next day was much of the same.  That night Shelly, Alan and I polished of a bottle of 15yr Glennfiddich I had requisitioned on a recent trip back to the states. There was much rejoicing.</p>
<p>The final day saw us making our way back down river.  I took my first and last turn at the helm.  A farely easy job one would think.  A job consisting of not keeping the vessel on the right side of the river and not running into the shore at a brisk pace of 5 mph.  Shortly after taking over and about 500 meters from our final destination. Alarms went off and the engined died.</p>
<p>We couldn&#39;t get it started.  We phoned in an S.O.S. and waited for the rescue ship.  Meanwhile, our houseboat was drifting into a row of private docks.  Luckily a resident came down to one with a look of &quot;WTF are you doing, mate?&quot;  After a panicky explanation he helped tie us off between two docks before we destroyed a dock.</p>
<p>Soon after the rescue team arrived and pulled us into safety.  Once there the engine started up fine.  Figures.</p>
<p>We cleaned up and departed.</p>
