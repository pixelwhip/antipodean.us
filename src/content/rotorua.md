Going to Rotorua would have been an amazing experience in and of itself, but to have a dedicated tour guide sets this place apart.  Should you venture to this geothermic wonderland, be sure to find Goesi and book yourself a tour with him!  Not only is he a gracious host (the accomodations were top notch!) but after taking us around Tokoroa, the Rock of Refuge, Huka Falls and Kuirau Park, he let me borrow his camera to shoot in and around St Faith's when my battery died (rookie mistake!).  I rather enjoy unique displays of nature, but this was a tour not to be missed.  I'm glad I was able to meet one of Travbuddy's best!
