We left town after work on Friday.  Arrived in Manuhm (sic) a couple hours later. We took the ferry across the river. Got to the boat. Said hello. Picked a room and unpacked.

Got into dinner and beers while the rest of the travellers arrived.

We spent the night moored at the ferry dock.

The next morning, we were breifed on piloting the house boat and let loose upon  the river.  We spent most the day pushing upstream at a leisurely pace.

We had one midday stop for a walk.  We moored among thick grasses and shrubs with the hopes of finding a trail along the seemingly wild rocky slopes beyond.  The Canadians bush wacked their way through a few meters of branchy bush to find that what lied beyond was not a hiking path, but a highway.

Not to be detered.   A few members of the party set off to stretch there legs along the rural properties of the populated road.

That night we setup camp on a stretch of land between the River and a lake.  We made a campfire, drank some wine and had a good ole aussie bbq.

The next day was much of the same.  That night Shelly, Alan and I polished of a bottle of 15yr Glennfiddich I had requisitioned on a recent trip back to the states. There was much rejoicing.

The final day saw us making our way back down river.  I took my first and last turn at the helm.  A farely easy job one would think.  A job consisting of not keeping the vessel on the right side of the river and not running into the shore at a brisk pace of 5 mph.  Shortly after taking over and about 500 meters from our final destination. Alarms went off and the engined died.

We couldn't get it started.  We phoned in an S.O.S. and waited for the rescue ship.  Meanwhile, our houseboat was drifting into a row of private docks.  Luckily a resident came down to one with a look of "WTF are you doing, mate?"  After a panicky explanation he helped tie us off between two docks before we destroyed a dock.

Soon after the rescue team arrived and pulled us into safety.  Once there the engine started up fine.  Figures.

We cleaned up and departed.
